## Remove queries normalization

Effective date: 2021-07-10

### Status
Queries normalization used by statements' collector has been removed.

### Context
Using our own normalization rules add differences between Postgres native normalized queries and queries normalized by pgSCV. 
Also, custom normalization adds extra ID (MD5 hash were used) for queries which is similar to native `queryid`.

### Decision
Remove query normalization routine and remove extra ID generated during normalization. Use native `queryid` provided by Postgres for query differentiation.

### Consequences
1. `NEGATIVE` This change statements metrics - `md5` label is replaced by `queryid` label.
2. `POSITIVE` Reduce complexity and ambiguity for people when comparing queries provided by pgSCV and Postgres.  
3. `POSITIVE` Keep compatibility between queries in Postgres and pgSCV (and Weaponry).
4. `POSITIVE` Minor performance improvement because no need to calculate MD5 sums.
